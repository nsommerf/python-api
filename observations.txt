Three observations from WeatherPy
1. There seems to be a definite correlation between Max Temperature and Latitude.  The farther you get from 0, the colder it gets.
2. I do not see any clear correlation beween cloud percent and Latitude.
3. Wind speed seems pretty consistent accross latitude.  Most seems to be within a certain range with few higher outliers.
